#vue issues

This is a repo full of issues I've found while working with VueJS back in 2019-2020. 

FYI 

Create a new Vue Project via the CLI and then performing build results in a build that is 980kb. 
Creating a new Angular project via the CLI and then performing build results in a build that is 728kb. 

A new Angular project starts out 252kb smaller than Vue.
